# Slimesteroids

**Trapped in space.  Surrounded by murderous slimes.  Will you survive?
An unfinished Lisp Game Jam submission.**

"- *pshhhspp* - this is the S.S. Ayedeekay -- *sshpss* -- we're being
attacked -- *ssshp* -- some sort of green blob --- *ssshhhsshshshsshshshsssss* "

It was supposed to be a normal supply run to the outer colonies.  Out of
nowhere a fast moving green slime overtook your vessel, surrounded it,
and killed all of the crew.  You barely made it out into a nimble escape
pod, and now must escape the slimes.

## Requirements
